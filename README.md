# Garbage-Collectyour
As the name implies, this is not a Garbage Collector, but it also isn't far from working towards the same end. The Garbage Collector _header only_ library, aims to create a wrapper around C's _malloc_ and _free_ which would keep track of memory allocations, and provide the user with a detailed rundown of memory issues when the program exits.
